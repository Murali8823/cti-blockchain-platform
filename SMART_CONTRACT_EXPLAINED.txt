                    SMART CONTRACT ROLE IN CTI BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM
                        Understanding the Core Engine of Our System
================================================================================

🧠 SMART CONTRACT: THE CORE ENGINE
================================================================================

WHAT IS CTIRegistry.sol?
Your CTIRegistry.sol is a Solidity smart contract that acts as the decentralized 
backend of your CTI platform. Think of it as a permanent, tamper-proof database 
and logic engine running on the Ethereum blockchain.

The smart contract is essentially the "BRAIN" and "BACKBONE" of your entire system.

🎯 KEY FUNCTIONS OF YOUR SMART CONTRACT
================================================================================

1. 📊 DATA STORAGE & MANAGEMENT
   ├── Data Structure:
   │   struct CTI {
   │       uint256 id;
   │       address submitter;
   │       string ipfsHash;
   │       string category;
   │       string title;
   │       uint256 timestamp;
   │       uint256 upvotes;
   │       uint256 downvotes;
   │       bool isActive;
   │   }
   │

   │   └── Active status management
   └── Benefit: Immutable, permanent threat intelligence database

2. 📝 CTI SUBMISSION SYSTEM
   ├── Function: submitCTI(string _ipfsHash, string _category, string _title)
   ├── What it does:
   │   ├── ✅ Accepts new threat intelligence submissions
   │   ├── ✅ Validates input data (no empty fields)
   │   ├── ✅ Assigns unique IDs to each submission
   │   ├── ✅ Records submitter's address
   │   ├── ✅ Timestamps the submission
   │   └── ✅ Emits events for transparency
   ├── Security Features:

3. 🗳️ VOTING & VALIDATION SYSTEM
   ├── Function: voteCTI(uint256 _id, bool _isUpvote)
   ├── What it does:
   │   ├── ✅ Allows community to vote on CTI quality
   │   ├── ✅ Prevents double voting (one vote per user per CTI)
   │   ├── ✅ Prevents self-voting (can't vote on own submissions)
   │   ├── ✅ Tracks upvotes and downvotes
   │   └── ✅ Calculates credibility scores
   ├── Anti-Manipulation Features:

   │   ├── Submitter check prevents self-voting
   │   ├── Boolean vote tracking (true=upvote, false=downvote)
   │   └── Transparent vote counting
   └── Community Benefit: Democratic quality assurance

4. 📈 SCORING & REPUTATION SYSTEM
   ├── Function: getCTIScore(uint256 _id) returns (int256)
   ├── What it does:
   │   ├── ✅ Calculates net score (upvotes - downvotes)
   │   ├── ✅ Provides credibility ranking
   │   └── ✅ Helps prioritize high-quality threats
   ├── Scoring Algorithm:
   │   ├── Positive Score: More upvotes than downvotes (trusted)
   │   ├── Zero Score: Equal votes (neutral)
   │   ├── Negative Score: More downvotes (questionable)
   │   └── Higher Score: Higher community trust
   └── Business Value: Enables threat prioritization

5. 🔍 DATA RETRIEVAL & PAGINATION
   ├── Function: getActiveCTIs(uint256 _limit, uint256 _offset)
   ├── What it does:
   │   ├── ✅ Retrieves CTI data efficiently
   │   ├── ✅ Supports pagination for large datasets
   │   ├── ✅ Returns most recent submissions first
   │   └── ✅ Filters active vs inactive CTIs
   ├── Scalability Features:
   │   ├── Limit parameter prevents gas limit issues
   │   ├── Offset enables pagination
   │   ├── Reverse chronological order (newest first)
   │   └── Active filtering reduces noise
   └── Performance Benefit: Handles thousands of CTI records
